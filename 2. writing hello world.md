## Basic Example of a Shell Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"
```
## Meaning of the previous example
* `#!/bin/bash` - This is called shebang. It is used to tell the system which interpreter to use to execute the rest of the script. In this case, we are using bash.
* `echo` - This is used to print the text to the screen.
* `"Hello World"` - This is the text that we want to print to the screen.

## How to run the previous example?
To run the previous example, you can use the following command:
```bash
bash hello_world.sh
```
The output will be like this:
```bash
Hello World
```
** Wrong!! You will get permission denied error. See the next section to solve this problem. **


## What's wrong with permission denied?
If you get the following error:
```bash
bash: ./hello_world.sh: Permission denied
```
It means that you don't have the permission to execute the script. To solve this problem, you can use the following command:
```bash
chmod +x hello_world.sh
```
The output will be like this:
```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 34 Aug  1 15:00 hello_world.sh
```
run the script again:
```bash
bash hello_world.sh
```
The output will be like this:
```bash
Hello World
```

## What does chmod +x mean?
* `chmod` - This is used to change the file mode bits of a file.
* `+x` - This is used to add execute permission for the file.

## What does the file mode bits mean?
The file mode bits are the permissions that are assigned to a file. There are three types of permissions: read, write and execute. Each permission can be assigned to three types of users: owner, group and others. The file mode bits are represented by 10 characters. The first character is the file type. The next three characters are the owner permissions. The next three characters are the group permissions. The last three characters are the others permissions. The following table shows the meaning of each character:

| Character | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- |
| - | No permission |
| r | Read permission |
| w | Write permission |
| x | Execute permission |

## How to check the file mode bits of a file?
To check the file mode bits of a file, you can use the following command:
```bash
ls -l hello_world.sh
```
The output will be like this:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 34 Aug  1 15:00 hello_world.sh
```
The first character is the file type. The next three characters are the owner permissions. The next three characters are the group permissions. The last three characters are the others permissions.



## How to run the previous example without bash?
To run the previous example without bash, you can use the following command:

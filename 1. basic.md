## Full Forms of the shells
* sh - Bourne shell.
 Means the original Unix shell developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs in 1977. 
* bash - Bourne again shell.
    Means the GNU Project's shell. It is a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. It is the default shell on Linux and Mac OS X. It was written by Brian Fox and Chet Ramey. It was released in 1989. It is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification. The improvements offered by Bash include: Command line editing, Unlimited size command history, Job Control, Shell Functions and Aliases, Indexed arrays of unlimited size, Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four. Bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).
